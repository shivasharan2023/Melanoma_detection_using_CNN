Melanoma_detection_using_Convolutional Nueral Netwroks
A multiclass classification custom CNN model in Tensorflow to detect 'Melanoma'
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

CNN model built using 2357 skin cancer images.
Model is built with the as is dataset, then a improved model is built on augmented data set, class imbalance is also handled to improve the model performance
The data set contains the following disease classes:
1.Actinic keratosis
2.Basal cell carcinoma
3.Dermatofibroma
4.Melanoma
5.Nevus
6.Pigmented benign keratosis
7.Seborrheic keratosis
8.Squamous cell carcinoma
9.Vascular lesion
